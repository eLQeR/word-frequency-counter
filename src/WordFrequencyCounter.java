            + "Asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously without blocking the main execution thread. "
            + "This enables the creation of more efficient and faster programs, particularly when dealing with large amounts of data or network-related tasks. "

            + "The lab I am working on is focused on asynchronously counting the frequency of words in a text. "
            + "I have created a Java program that utilizes a ConcurrentHashMap to count the frequency of words in a large text, which is divided into several parts. "
